                        <p>I am excited about research specially in the fields of Internet, Peer to Peer Networks, Bayesian Estimation, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. </p>
                        <p>After earning my Diploma in Mathematics from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Organization_for_Development_of_Exceptional_Talents">Natinoal Organization for Development of Exceptional Tallents (NODET)</a> in Karaj Iran, I continued my education on Computer Engineering &ndash; Software in Qazvin Azad University, which is known for the best research opportunities on Robotics among Iranian universities. I joined <a href="http://mrl-spl.ir">Mechatronics Research Laboratory - Standard Platform League (MRL-SPL)</a> and earned undergraduate research scholarship. My B.Sc. Study is going to finish on July 2017.</p>
                        <p>During my activity in MRL-SPL, I involved in and initated serveral research projects &mdash; selectively listed below &mdash; and won several competition/research awards in <a href="http://www.robocup.org/">RoboCup</a>. During this experience, I worked on Non-Parameteric Bayesian Estimation, Kalman Filtering, Monter Carlo Localization, Motion Planning, Kinematics Analysis, Simulation, Biped Locomotion, and Autonomus Agents. Besides, it provided me with a great teamwork experience which taught me Agile Software Development and Leadership and Organization Skills.</p>
