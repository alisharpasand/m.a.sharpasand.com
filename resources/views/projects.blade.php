                        <p>In the context of Internet Of Things, there has always been the challenge of price and ease of installation. Beside the size of networks as measured by number of nodes, these challenges lead to inefficiency of conventional networks. There is a need for a simple, cheap, low-range and low-power network for interconnecting hundreds of devices. I am building a simplified peer to peer network using cheap and low-power radio frequency transceivers and Arduino boards.</p>

                        <p>Most of joint position sensors and cameras need calibration in order to provide accurate data on humanoid robots. Calibrating theses sensors, however, needs external device which has to be manufactured very precisely. Otherwise, measurements of the calibration parameters are co-dependent for camera and joints. Simultaneous calibration requires solving an under-determined system of equations. This ambiguity has to be resolved. We are working on a technique to resolve this ambiguity and construct a determined system of equations.</p>
