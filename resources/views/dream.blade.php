                    <p><em>Internet</em> stands as the symbol of freedom for me and it represents human maturity. This priceless communication media, however, is not as liberal as possible yet. There are still limitations and impediments to it. Since I come from where there are the most content limitations on the internet, I understand and feel how one can impose a lot of problems to it. Observing the Internet moving many people out of darkness of imposition and isolation around the world beside the map of its freedom (the above map) shapes my dream: <blockquote>&ldquo;The world where everyone can access and help develop a connected, borderless, limitless Internet that creates opportunity and progress for all.&rdquo;</blockquote><span class="cite">&mdash;Internet Society</span></p>
