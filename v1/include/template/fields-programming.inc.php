		<h2>Computer Programming</h2>
		<p>I have started computer programming in 2004, with learning <em>Pascal</em>, then I continued with <em>Delphi</em>.  Later, after working with <em>PHP</em>, it was easy for me to learn <em>C++</em>, with which and a little <em>C#</em>, followed by it, I passed two levels of OmidNGO competitions with cooperation with Farbod Taghizade.  OmidNGO competitions was held in three stages, two of which we passed, however the third stage canceled by the organization due to some unexplained reasons.</p>
		<p>In December 2009, I had teamed up with two other C++ programmres, <em>Mohammad Kamalzare</em> and <em>Mojtaba Mousavi</em>, to participate in <strong>Junior ACM</strong>.  Although we had only three days for getting ready for it, as we were notified late, we ranked among top fifth in competition with tallented programmers, all over nation.</p>
		<p>In this field, despite that all of my works in robotics are related with computer programming, I have done a variety of projects including <a href="/previous-projects/?project_id=8">Head Motion Planning of the NAO robots</a> and <em>Behavior Control</em> of them in MRL, as well as the <a href="/previous-projects/?project_id=4">Intelligent reception system</a> of HUGER, our school&rsquo;s sientific assembly.</p>
		<p>My expriences in computer programming mainly fits in <strong>Linux</strong> platform, and following are the programming languages I have worked with:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>C++</li>
			<li>Python</li>
			<li>PHP</li>
			<li>Bash</li>
			<li>Matlab</li>
			<li>C#</li>
			<li>Pascal</li>
			<li>Delphi</li>
		</ul>
