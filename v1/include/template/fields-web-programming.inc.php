		<h2>Web Design</h2>
		<p>I&rsquo;ve started web design professionally since 2005, when one of my friends, <em>Farbod Taghizadeh</em>, and I initiated our web design venture, <strong>Eniac Group</strong>.  I have continued my activity in this area with accepting private web design orders.  Later, in our team, <strong>Matorang</strong>, two of my friends and I were working on our e-commerce plans such as <strong><a href="/previous-projects/?project_id=6">Matorang.biz</a></strong>.  We accepted several other projects including <strong><a href="/previous-projects/?project_id=7">Hotel Canary&rsquo;s website</a>.</strong></p>
		<p>Having done about 13 web design projects, I was ready to be employed in <em><a href="http://jpa7.com/">Jahan Pardazesh Alborz Inc.</a></em> as supervisor of the web design team.  One of the most recent works of mine is the website you are currently in (<a href="http://m.a.sharpasand.com/">My personal website</a>).</p>
		<p>I can name myself a skilled web programmer as it has been my main field of activity for a long time ago.  My skills in order of profeciency are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><em>PHP</em> Programming</li>
			<li>Database Design</li>
			<li><em>JavaScript</em> programming including <em>AJAX</em></li>
			<li><em>XHTML</em>, cross browser mark up</li>
			<li><em>CSS</em> Level 2.1</li>
			<li><em>Search Engine Optimization</em> (SEO)</li>
			<li>Configuring <em>Aapche</em> (<em>LAMP Server</em>)</li>
		</ul>
