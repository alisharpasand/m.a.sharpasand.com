		<h2>Robotics</h2>
		<p>I&rsquo;ve started robotic in 2005. I was one of the few people in our school who had robotic activities.  Therefore, following robotic competitions and contests was a challenge itself.  However, In 2008, 5 friends of mine and I started a <a href="/previous-projects/?project_id=5">RoboCup Junior</a> team for the first time in our school.  In 2010, we qualified both form <em>Khwarizmi Robotic Contest</em> and <em>IranOpen Competitions</em>.  I was leading our team and designing electrical ciruits.</p>
		<p>In 2011, I joined <a href="http://mrl.ir/">Mechatronics Research laboratory (MRL)</a>, the most well-known and the biggest robotics laboratory in Iran.  I am working in Standard Platform League of RoboCup, on NAO robots.</p>
		<p>From my robotic projects I can name <a href="/previous-projects/?project_id=8">Head Motion Planning for SPL</a> and <a href="/previous-projects/?project_id=5">Our junior RoboCup robot</a>.</p>
