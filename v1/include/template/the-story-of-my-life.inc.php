		<h2>The Story of My Life</h2>
		<p>Here, I want to say how I have lived and how I want to live in future.  My <strong>targets</strong>, my <strong>dreams</strong> and my <strong>opinios</strong> are going to be here.</p>
		<p>However, right now, there is nothing here.  This doesn&rsquo;t mean that I don&rsquo;t have any targets, but I haven&rsquo;t written its story yet.  I applogize for not filling this page, and hope to do this soon.</p>
